# Classify images of animals using LSVM 

The package contains 
a1dogtrain.m -- learns and test an image classifier on dog
a2goattrain.m -- learns and test an image classifier on mountaingoat
a3tortoisetrain.m -- learns and test an image classifier on tortoise
a1dogtrainRotate.m -- learns and test an image classifier on original and augmented dog images dataset

use vlfeat-0.9.20 library
computeHistogramsFromImageList.m -- compute the historgrams for list of images
computeVocabularyFromImageList.m -- compute the visual word vocabulary for list of images
cropImageSet.m -- crop the images in a given directory
getImageSet.m -- scan a directory for images
randomSplitImgFile -- randomly choose number train data from each path and combined into a file
rotateImageSet.m -- given a directory, for each image rotate it from 72 to 288 (add 4 rotated images) 
setup.m -- add the required search paths of vlfeat library to MATLAB
standardizeImage.m -- rescale an image with height <= 400 
trainLinearSVM.m -- Learn a linear support vector machine.
plotROC3M.m and getTPRFPRCI3.m plot the typical ROC curves and CI of TPR and FPR
